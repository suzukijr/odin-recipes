                <li>Butter</li>

        <h3>Step-by-Step</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Turn the oven on to 450 degrees to preheat and prepare a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Then, add the milk and stir.</li>
                <li>Now dip the cauliflower bites into the milk mixture, turn them to coat completely, shake off any excess milk, then arrange them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Put the buffalo cauliflower in the oven to bake for 10 minutes. Turn the cauliflower pieces over with a fork, then put back into the oven for another 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the cauliflower cooks, make the buffalo wing sauce by combining the butter, buffalo wing sauce, and honey in a medium saucepan, bringing it to a boil over medium heat, stirring and cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Finally, brush the buffalo sauce all over the baked cauliflower, bake them again for another 10 minutes. Serve fresh with ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping.</li>
